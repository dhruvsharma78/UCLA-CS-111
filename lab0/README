Description of files:

    * lab0.c         - The source file that contains all subroutines and the main routine.
    * Makefile       - The makefile with build targets to:
      	       	             * build the executable
		             * create the distributable tarball
		             * clean the build directory after tarball creation / compilation

    * backtrace.png  - Shows the stacktrace after a segfault as captured in gdb
    * breakpoint.png - Shows the breakpoint and variable inspection
    * README         - this file

Smoke Test Cases:

    These are the simple smoke-test cases I checked for in my Makefile check target:
    	  * Basic funtionality - Checks if output and input are same
	  * Support for input file argument - Checks if program recognizes and supports it
	  * Support for output file argument - Checks if program recognizes and supports it
	  * Unrecognized arguments - Checks if program exists appropriately
	  * Read permission error - Checks if program exists appropriately on read permission error
	  * Write permission error - Checks if program exists appropriately on write permission error
	  * Catching segmentation faults - Checks if program catches fault and exists appropriately
	  * Core dump - Checks if --dump-core option has intended effect
	  * Output file creation - Check if output file can be created if doesn't exist
	  * No input file - Check if program exists appropriately if can't find input file

Research Done for Project:

    * For this project, I first read all the man pages suggested on the course website
    * For the most part, building the most basic version of the project was easy, but became harder when
      I began adding support for option parsing
      It took quite a while to understand how the API worked but I was able to follow along the examples
      in the 'notes' section of the man page
    * I didn't quite understand what was meant by dumping cores. I was able to understand through the TA's
