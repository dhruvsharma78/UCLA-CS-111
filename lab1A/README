    * README	      - This file
    * Makefile	      - The makefile for this project with build targets to:
      		          * Build the executable
			  * Create distribution tarball
			  * Clean the build/source directory
			  * Run basic testing on built executable

Test Cases:

    The Makefile runs the following very basic tests:
    	* Handling of bogus/unsupported options
	* File opening on valid arguments
	* File opening error handling on invalid arguments
	* Functionality of running basic commands

Research:
	
    * Handling option parsing in C with multiple arguments
    * Efficiently parsing and storing flags for file I/O
    * Process forking and execvp()

Extra Features:

    * I implemented data structures to keep hold of all commands the user wants to run.
      This is of no use right now, but in the future, for Lab 1B&C, it will help me keep
      track of all processes.
    * I also implemented a custom file table. I did this because file descriptors in
      this shell work a little differently. For example, even if the 4th open call fails,
      file descriptor 3 will no longer be used for any future file. Using my custom file
      table, I can easily keep track of the mappings of the simpsh fd's to the real OS fd's
      and also easily set and get their status values (whether they failed or not).
