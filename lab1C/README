************************************************************************************************

    * --profile has been implemented. This outputs the time taken to process each option and
      also the total time spent by wait-ed for child processes.

    * A new option --debug-shell-profile was added to display total shell time. This helps
      in understanding how fast simpsh is compared to other shells.

    * Fixed a bug in signal.c that had an illegal array index assignment.

    * Added the optimization flag to gcc compile commands. Also moved the debugging flag to
      the debug target

    * Created report on performance reports of simpsh compared to bash and dash on some basic
      cases.
      
************************************************************************************************

Known Bugs:

    * In forked child processes, dprintf is used to print to a dup'd descriptor pointing to
      stderr. This print is not flushed and may potentially cause issues.

    * README	      - This file
    * report.pdf      - A comparison of simpsh performance with bash & dash
    * Makefile	      - The makefile for this project with build targets to:
      		          * Build the executable
			  * Create distribution tarball
			  * Clean the build/source directory
			  * Run basic testing on built executable

Smoke Tests:

    The Makefile runs the following very basic tests:
    	* Handling of bogus/unsupported options
	* File opening on valid arguments
	* File opening error handling on invalid arguments
	* Functionality of running basic commands
	* Pipe functionality
	* Wait functionality

Research:
	
    * Handling option parsing in C with multiple arguments
    * Efficiently parsing and storing flags for file I/O
    * Process forking and execvp()
    * Handling signals, raising signals
    * Waiting for child processes
    * Computing time differences using timeval structs


Citations:

    * The function used to calculate time differences for timeval structs
      was largely inspired by the one used in the libc manual.
